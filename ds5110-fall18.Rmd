## Overview

This course discusses the practical issues and techniques for data importing, tidying, transforming, and modeling. It offers a gentle introduction to techniques for processing big data. Programming is a cross-cutting aspect of the course. Students will gain experience with data science tools through short assignments. The course work includes a term project based on real-world data. Required topics include: Data management and processing: definition & background; Data transformation; Data import; Data cleaning; Data modeling; Relational and analytic databases; Basics of SQL; Programming in R; MapReduce fundamentals and distributed data management; Data processing pipelines, connecting multiple data management and analysis components; Interaction between the capabilities and requirements of data analysis methods (data structures, algorithms, memory requirements) and the choice of data storage and management tools; Repeatable and reproducible data analysis.

## Homework

Three individual homework assignments are to be completed for this class. Each homework is due by email before class on the day it is listed, unless the instructions specify otherwise. Late homeworks will not be accepted. Extensions may be given individually if requested at least 48 hours in advance of the due date with a reasonable justification.

Some aspects of the homework may be discussed with each other, but they should be completed indivudually, and your submitted work should be your own. Sharing of worked solutions will not be tolerated and will be considered cheating. Solutions with a very high degree of similarity with another past or current student's will be considered plagiarism, and will be treated accordingly.

***

## Exams

There will be one midterm exam and one final exam. Both will be completed in class on the dates scheduled above.

***

## Project

There will be a final project done in groups of 3 to 4 students. More details will be posted later in the semester.

***

## Grading

The grade in this class is based out of 1000 points, distributed as follows:

- Homework: 3 x 100 pts
- Midterm Exam: 200 pts
- Final Exam: 200 pts
- Final Project: 300 pts
	- Project proposal: 50 pts
	- In-class presentation: 100 pts
	- Final written report: 150 pts

Final grades will be given on the following scale:

- A : 900 - 1000 pts
- B : 800 - 899 pts
- C : 700 - 799 pts
- F : <= 699 pts

Half-letter-grades ('+' and '-') may be given as well.

This scale is subject to change at the discretion of the instructor.
